* Code of Conduct escalation discussion

## Minutes

* CPC Chair election schedule [#549](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/549)
  * Joe has written up doc on experience, https://hackmd.io/@joesepi/cpc-chair-experience

* Project charter review for AMP [#552](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/552)

Discussing concerns around breaking charter out into separate linked docs

* Tobie: not expecting TSC to be concerned about governance being reviewed by CPC just as it would the charter
* Michael: suggests documenting above in AMP charter
Consensus: need to add a sentence or two (Michael will suggest some wording). Two weeks have elapsed. Need to approvals (Michael and Joe commit to those approvals) and then we can move forward. No need for board approval. 

* Code of Conduct escalation path/process discussion

  * Michael: the crux is should we or shouldn’t we (CoC “panel”) be available as an escalation path? Concern of projects could be turning trust over to an outside panel for moderation.

* CoC Panel could provide resources for projects/communities
* CoC Panel could be a place to escalate
* CoC Panel could be a place to hold violation information in case of cross-project bad activity
* CoC Panel could ban a member from a project
* CoC Panel could advise banning a member from a project

CoC escalation path scenarios:
- Appeal: project moderates an issue; offender disagrees and escalates to CoC Panel
- No Confidence: reporter has issue CoC violation issue with leadership
